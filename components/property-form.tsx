- **Property Listings**: Filterable properties by type (house/store) and transaction (buy/rent)
- **Property Details**: Individual property pages with image galleries and booking forms
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Admin Features:

## Key Components:

The site includes placeholder data for demonstration. In a production environment, you'd integrate with a database and authentication system for the admin features. */
